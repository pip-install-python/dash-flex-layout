"""Cache lifetimes for the static files this app serves (1.6.44 item 6g).

pannellum's finding, and it reproduces here. MEASURED on this host's wire
2026-09-05, before the change::

    GET https://flexlayout.2plot.dev/assets/main.css
    cache-control: no-cache
    cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC

so the CDN in front of this host stored nothing and every visitor
revalidated the stylesheet and the scripts on every page load. `no-cache`
does not mean "do not store" — it means "revalidate before use" — but the
effect through Cloudflare is the same: the edge declines to serve it and the
origin answers every request.

Only ``/assets/`` is given a lifetime here, and deliberately:

* Dash's own ``/_dash-component-suites/`` URLs are fingerprinted and the
  package already sets a long immutable lifetime on them — a second opinion
  from this app could only make that worse;
* documents must keep revalidating. A page, ``/llms.txt``, ``/healthz`` and
  anything under ``/admin`` or ``/api`` are answers about right now, and one
  hour of a stale one is a bug report nobody can reproduce.

The window is one hour with a day of ``stale-while-revalidate``: assets here
are NOT fingerprinted (``main.css`` keeps its name across deploys), so the
lifetime is the longest a CSS fix may take to reach a returning reader.

THIS FORK IS FLASK-ONLY (DIVERGENCES 2), so there is one lane to wire and no
`lib/asgi_middleware.py` to keep in step. The module still exists separately
from run.py so the policy has one home rather than being spelled inline at
the seam that applies it.
