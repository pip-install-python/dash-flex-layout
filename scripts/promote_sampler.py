"""Sample the wire and the CD run state on ONE timeline, across a promote.

The concrete form of trap 3(a) (1.6.44 item 17; pannellum 15917bc,
modelviewer 540926a, emojimart 166e33a, clerkhook f1481f5). It answers one
question — does Render react to the PUSH or to the PROMOTE? — and it answers
it on a green push, without waiting for a red one.

Three things this does that a hand-written watcher gets wrong:

1. ONE LOOP, ONE TIMELINE. The wire and the run state are sampled in the
   same iteration. Two separate reconstructions invite exactly the
   arithmetic error the measurement exists to avoid.

2. TIMES AGAINST THE PROMOTE STEP'S `completed_at`, never the deploy JOB's.
   The job CONTAINS the build-match wait, so it completes when the wait SEES
   the swap: it tracks the swap and never the promote, and landed at -13 s
   and 0 s on this host's two measured pairs. Useless for timing either way.

3. RETRIES EACH SAMPLE THREE TIMES and records `unreadable` as a state
   DISTINCT from `old`. The container restart lands exactly where the
   bracket needs its sample — twice out of two on this host — so an
   un-retried loop is systematically blind at the only moment that matters,
   and collapsing unreadable into old invents a bracket nobody observed.

4. TWO CONSECUTIVE BAD READS BEFORE ANY VERDICT (note 149a, modelviewer).
   Mid-swap `/healthz` returns an empty or unparseable body for ONE tick
   with `release` already moved — a container restarting, not an outage. A
   watcher that calls that wrong cries wolf; one that reads it as "the run
   vanished" repeats the rate-limit mistake in a new costume. A single
   unreadable sample is an ordinary member of the bracket here; two in a
   row is reported as a condition in its own right.

5. PRINTS THE PUSH -> PROMOTE GAP beside the bracket (note 128a). The whole
   inference is that a push-watching Render would have swapped EARLIER than
   observed — which only separates the two triggers when the gap is bigger
   than the build+swap time. Under ~3 minutes the two hypotheses predict
   the same wire, and the honest output is "no verdict possible" rather
   than a number that looks like evidence.

The result is STRONG EVIDENCE, never proof: a queued or slow build could in
principle produce the same shape. The canonical discriminator is still the
first push that goes RED on main leaving `release` unmoved and the wire
unchanged. This host has not had one, so its `deploy:` fence row is
UNPROVEN and stays that way until it does — four hosts declined to call it
proven on a green push and that refusal is the standard.
